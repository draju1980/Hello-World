# Write a function that finds the magnitude of a given 3-dimensional vector.
# The magnitude of a vector is the square root of sum of squares of all the components of the vector.
# magnitude=√x2+y2+z2  Your input for this function will be a (vector with x,y,z components)
# a list containing 3 integers i.e, [x,y,z]. For example if the input list is:
# vector = [2, 3, -4]
# Then you should return the magnitude (as a floating point number) of this vector:
# 5.385164807134504
